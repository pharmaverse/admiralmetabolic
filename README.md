## Extension Expectations

To be included as an `{admiral}` package extension we expect developers
to adhere to the following standards:

-   [Code of
    Conduct](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html)
-   [Manifesto](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/index.html?q=manifest#admiral-manifesto)
-   [Programming
    Strategy](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/articles/programming_strategy.html)
-   Follow consistent workflow checks
-   A CRAN Release means 90% or greater test coverage

We have developed this repository template in order to reduce the burden
on developers to follow these standards. This template will also help to
harmonize the `{admiral}` family of R packages, to ensure a consistent
user experience and ease of installing and adopting all the packages.
With this in mind, we expect the same core package dependencies and
versions as used for `{admiral}`.

## What is included in the template

The repository template includes the following:

-   License file (Apache 2.0 - but company co-developers need to be
    added to copyright section)
-   Required folders (R; test; templates; vignettes; etc)
-   Set-up files (DESCRIPTION; NAMESPACE; etc)
-   Issue Templates (Bug Template; Feature Request; Documentation
    Request/Update; Onboarding)
-   Pull Request Template
-   Workflow actions (a selection of generic and specific CI/CD
    auto-checks)
-   Package badges (Test coverage; etc)
-   Branch protection rules

## Package Extension Guidance
